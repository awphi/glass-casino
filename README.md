# GlassCasino
GlassCasino was my 3rd year BSc ComSci Dissertation project @ Durham University. The project consisted of building a docmpletely decetranlised, fair and transparent iGaming platform and evaluating its technical viability. I can provide the full academic paper on request.

# UPDATE 27/01/2023
I'm keen to allow people to use this project as a foundation for their own work or commercial projects. However, I want to ensure the "glass" component of GlassCasino remains enforced. Therefore I've applied the [GNU GPLv3 license](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/) to this project. Please read the full terms in the LICENSE file.
